## WELCOME IN MY GITHUB REPOSITORY

#### Introduction

In this repository, I have 2 projects:

- Cloudbank AI

- Loan Data Exploration

#### I. Cloudbank AI

In the ever-evolving landscape of modern banking, CloudBank stands at the forefront of innovation with its groundbreaking AI project. This initiative aims to redefine customer support within the banking sector by harnessing the power of artificial intelligence. At the heart of this endeavor lies the development of a sophisticated chatbot designed specifically for the CloudBank application, heralding a new era of personalized assistance and seamless user experience.

The primary objective of the CloudBank AI chatbot is to provide comprehensive support to customers utilizing the bank's application. From answering general inquiries to troubleshooting technical issues, the chatbot serves as a virtual assistant, available round-the-clock to address the diverse needs of CloudBank's clientele. Moreover, the chatbot goes beyond traditional customer support by offering interactive tutorials on how to navigate the bank application effectively, empowering users with the knowledge they need to make the most of their banking experience.

With its advanced natural language processing capabilities and machine learning algorithms, the CloudBank AI chatbot continuously evolves and adapts to user interactions. By learning from customer queries and feedback, it refines its responses over time, ensuring unparalleled accuracy and relevance. Through this innovative approach to customer support, CloudBank aims to not only enhance user satisfaction but also foster a deeper understanding of its banking application among clients, ultimately paving the way for a more seamless and intuitive banking experience.

##### Some Functionnalities of this application

1. ###### Choose the document to query in the documentation
   
   It's possible through the left panel, for all users, to choose which documents of the company documentation to interrogate, and also if the visitor or the user doesn't know which documents contain his answer, he can ask an question without choosing a document, and the chatbot will iterate through all the available documents in order to find the good answer to give him. The goal of this feature is to make the answer of the robot as accurate as possible.

2. ###### Ask any question and get the right answer
   
   There the visitor can speak with the robot at anytime he wishes to.
